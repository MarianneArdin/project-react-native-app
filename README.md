# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This was my first project in React Native.

## The challenge

As many other students in my class, I got plenty of errors at first. I had to review my initial plan for the project and make it simpler.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
