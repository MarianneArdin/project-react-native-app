# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

This was my first project using React Native and Expo and I chose to build a project teching APIs.

## The challenge

It took me a while to get my head around components in React Native and fetching the APIs.

## View it live

Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.
